# HTML5_CSS3_Website_Practice
HTML5, CSS3 Project


In this project, I used advanced selectors, colors, fonts, backgrounds, borders, and links etc. to create a simple website using HTML5 and CSS3. I used display, float and clear tags along with margins, paddings, and transforms to adjust the positionality of elements. I used various link states and transitions as well to add interactivity, especially while creating a table.
